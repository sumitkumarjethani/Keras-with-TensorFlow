# Keras-with-TensorFlow
This series will teach you how to use Keras, a neural network API written in Python.

Keras - Python Deep Learning Neural Network API

We will learn how to preprocess data, organize data for training, build and train an artificial neural network from scratch,
build and fine-tune convolutional neural networks (CNNs), implement fine-tuning and transfer learning, deploy our models using both
front-end and back-end deployment techniques, and much more!
